there is the house
she is a fool he added aloud
to the light
his legs shook
he took the purse too
pour it out
he felt disgusted
so its to let
for shes a fool 
there is a daughter too 
let us talk
i thought that too
just a little
i heard that too
he raised his head
she is afraid he thought
oh all right
i had the pleasure 
let us go together
ill tell her 
that is all right
he killed her too
take a good look
of that sort 
she is dead he said
he stood at the door
let s rather talk of that 
perhaps she 
that is right that is right
i stopped at the group of people
he shook his head
there is still hope
he slept little
i slept little
the house is deserted
the jailer stared
he is pursued
that is true
the spade perhaps
julie hesitated
here it is said he
as luigi spoke thus he left her
the host shook his head
read that he said
ali appeared
she passed first
like a philosopher
i thought so
ali reappeared
for his death
look added he
that is to the purpose
adieu sir she said
read she said
here he said here is a draft at sight
it does her all right
it is all right
pour out the tea there
let us get out of the kip
all laughed
thought is the thought of thought
lal the ral the ra
just look through it
shake a shake
goes like this
take all keep all
hide gold there
the truth spit it out
i see her skirties
street of harlots
she she she
there he is
looked shut
the oldest people
seaside girls
has the fidgets
he liked to read at stool
household slops
tara street
allude to it
still true to life also
the far east
petals too tired to
he is dead he said
their eldorado
to keep it up
footdrill stopped
joseph her spouse
god is little joke
he stood up
take off the rough dirt
he is right
dearest papli
there all right
the shape is there still
like a hero
dead side of the street this
start afresh
seal up all
also hearses
the last house
he stepped out
first i heard of it
thou art peter
the ree the ra the ree the ra the roo
desire to grig people
the death struggle
flag of distress
like stuffed
faithful departed
there he goes
ashes to ashes
poor papa too
hate at first sight
he has a house there too
life is too short
that is all right
i hear feetstoops
ill read the rest after
look at here
that is press
south pout out shout drouth
a polished period j
let us hope j
after he ll see
i like that
i see the idea
heart to heart talks
pepper s ghost idea
sea air sours it i heard
the thoughts
eat pig like pig
there is a priest
she is right after all
our staple food
pillar of salt
let her speak
up she said
all skedaddled
i detest that so tasteless
he other side of her
duke street
his gorge rose
good stroke
jugged hare
that is right
people ought to help
dear dear dear
to the right
just at the gate
hesouls shesouls shoals of souls
the pigs paper
i feel that russell is right
he stopped at the stairfoot
street of harlots after
the little house
all right sir
through here
dress does it
just a flash like that
great topers too
a lore of drugs
tattered pages
i told her of paris
it is all right
death that is
throstle fluted
i feel so sad
at four she said
he strolled
at four she
at four she
sit tight there
to flora s lips did hie
all trio laughed
appropriate
or he feels

to keep it up
to keep it up

people afraid of the dark
a star i see
there he goes
i felt her pulse
dearest papli
fate that is
of that house a
thou art all their daddies theodore
full of a dure
for the hoi polloi
there is hair
here is to us
there she goes
illustrate thou
he disappears
keep keep keep to the right
he looks up
hee hee hee
o let it slide
a plagiarist
perhaps here
he hesitates
the rite is the poet is rest
it restores
seek thou the light
though our ages
out of it out of it
that priest
droop shoulders
she is right our sister
sister agatha
it goes out
street of harlots
he stops dead
he hurries out through the hall
the girl there
i heard that
it is all right
he jerks the rope
gallop of hoofs
he is a professor
she hurries out

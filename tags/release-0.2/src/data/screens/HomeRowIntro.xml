      <text>   Welcome to the home row lesson series.  The home row keys are the keys on the middle row of the keyboard, starting with 'a' and ending with ';'.  In this series of lessons, you be introduced to each of these keys, and have a chance to practice them.  A minimum of 90% accuracy is required, so be sure to focus on accuracy rather than speed.
